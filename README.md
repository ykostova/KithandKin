KithandKin
==========

Intergenerational communication system

The system was a product of an extensive research involving users from the User Center of University of Dundee.
It was part of 3rd year Applied Computing core module Human Computer Interaction.
The system high fidelity prototype uses HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript / Jquery with Ajax as core technologies. 

‘Kith and Kin’ evolved from the need to provide support for the older generation in the digital photograph sharing 
process. As technology rapidly develops the older generations are being left behind their younger acquaintances. There 
are some systems which support photograph sharing with transparent security settings and some which support online 
sharing but none that were found which performed both.

Using a User-Centred-Design (UCD) approach, ‘Kith and Kin’ was iteratively developed to reflect the needs of three user
groups and incorporate the aforementioned features as its focus. This form of intergenerational communication had users 
at its core and responded appropriately to the discussions in line with Human Computer Interaction (HCI). ‘Kith and Kin’
uses a metaphor of physical photographs presenting a familiar structure encouraging a story telling dialogue that was 
previously lost in the popularity of digital photographs.
